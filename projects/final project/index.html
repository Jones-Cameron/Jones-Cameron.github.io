        <br><p>In the United States today, even in the midst of a pandemic, sports dominate people's lives. In 2019, approximately 154.4 million people watched live sports content at least once per month in the US, a figure that is projected to rise to over 160 million by 2024, according to research expert <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127341/live-sport-viewership/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20approximately%20154.4%20million,over%20160%20million%20by%202024">David Lange.</a></p>

        <p>Sports are not only watched by millions, but played by millions every day, especially children. According to data from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/986512/participation-kids-sport/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20source%2C%2071.8,at%20least%20once%20in%202018">2011 to 2018,</a> 72 percent of children in the US from the age of 6 to 12 played sports at least one day a year. And while the statistic may seem small, sports dominate the youth setup.</p>

        <p>Kids have dreamed of becoming athletes for a long time and will continue to do so. According to a survey of 2,000 adults, 17 percent of male respondents had dreamed of being a professional athlete, the highest of any job, according to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/19/the-most-popular-dream-jobs-kids-want-to-do-when-they-grow-up/">New York Post</a> in 2019. </p>

        <p>This dream of becoming an athlete is not something new. It has been chronicled in movies like “Hoop Dreams,” and become a popular goal for young athletes around the nation. The question is, is this dream achievable?</p>
     
        <p>In 2014, the NCAA released a report which included the probability of playing collegiate and professional sports. The results speak for themselves. According to the report, there were around 7.4 million high school student athletes in 2014. The most coming from football, 1.1 million and most of the women coming from basketball, 433,100. </p>

        <p>Out of all those high school athletes, many of whom aspire to play professionally, only 6 percent make it to the collegiate level. That's only around 450 thousand. In 2014 there were 460,000 athletes in the NCAA. Only 2 percent of those athletes will ever play professionally, with the most success coming baseball at 9 percent. </p>

        <p>In the NCAA, only 1 percent of basketball players and 2 percent of football players will be drafted. On top of this, being drafted does not guarantee a contract or career in the NBA, NFL, or other league.</p>
   
        <p>So, the harsh reality is that the dream that is so common among many children in the US is incredibly difficult to attain. And once it is attained, most athletes don’t maintain it for very long. According to a study published in the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pro-athletes-big-winners-_b_5504073#:~:text=The%20average%20career%20span%20for,a%20financial%20plan%20is%20essential">Huffington Post</a> in 2014, the average career length for an athlete is 10 years, and only 3.5 years for football players. </p>

        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/average-retirement-age-in-the-united-states-2388864">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, data shows that the retirement age in the United States averages at 65 for men and 63 for women. That means that even if an athlete achieves their goal of playing professionally, they’re most likely going to have to work another job for upwards of 25 years. </p>

        <p>Additionally, student athletes tend not to be as successful in school as non-athletes. According to <a href="https://www.theclassroom.com/academics-college-athletes-vs-nonathletes-16678.html">The New York Times</a>, recruited male athletes earn an average GPA of just 2.84. That is 0.13 points lower than walk-on athletes and 0.20 points lower than male non-athletes, according to a study. This means that once out of a job in a professional league, former athletes may be less prepared for a “typical” job than a student who didn’t dream of playing professionally. </p>

        <p>So while wanting to be amn athlete is a common dream and will continue to be, the harsj reality is that few children with that goal will really achieve it.
